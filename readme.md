#DecimalPrettyPrint
##Synopsis
This library can be used to convert an integer to a pretty printed decimal number for display.

##Code Example
###Assignment
Devise a function that takes an input 'n' (integer) and returns a string that is the decimal representation of that number grouped by commas after every 3 digits. You CAN NOT solve the task using a built-in formatting function that can accomplish the whole task on its own.

###Example Output
1 -> "1"
10 -> "10"
100 -> "100"
1000 -> "1,000"
10000 -> "10,000"
100000 -> "100,000"
1000000 -> "1,000,000"
35235235 -> "35,235,235"

###Assumptions
From the instructions given, the following assumptions can be deducted from it:
- 0 <= n < 1000000000

###Code Snippet
ToDo.
